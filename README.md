Hi GitWorld, I am looking for collaborators and like minded futuritsts.

Since 1991, I've edited video, that has expanded to everything post and also manufacturer. 
Infact, if you've edited video on a computer, its likely some inspiration came from 
the products I was a PM for, FAST/Pinnacle/Avid Liquid editing software and most recently
Avid NEXIS|EDGE. 

I am now launching a new company, and products, first breadcrumb:
open-source 


Since 2018, working daily in Burbank, California, I have
gained firsthand understanding of the challenges digital
creators face. Growing data libraries, the need to monetize
investments, and staying cutting-edge in both technology
and artistry drive every creator to seek a better way.
The Products are the results of this
experience and dedication, offering tools to gain an
advantage over previous solutions.-
